              <li>Thank you for inviting me to give a talk today. Before we start I'd like to draw
                your attention to the conference MCEB that we are organising again this year. We had to
                cancel last year's edition but this year, we should be able to have a regular meeting.
                It will take place in the south of France, in Porquerolles, in June. So, if you'd like to register and
                even present your work, please feel free to do so through this website. The
                deadline in Monday.</li>
              <li>Now, in my talk today, I will focus on  population genetics models with a spatial
                component. We usually refer to these models as phylogeographic models</li>
                <li>More specifically,
               I am interested in incorporating knowledge about spatial sampling patterns in these
                models. By sampling patterns, I mean that the sampling of genetic sequences in space is
                not always uniform and that deviations for uniformity may not reflect the outcome of
                the evolutionary process

              <li> I am not the only one, nor the first person concerned with these issues that
              impact phylogeography but also other related research areas too</li>
              <li>In fact, back in 2005, Simon Frost and other fairly knowledgeable people in the
              field came up with a list of eight challenges in phylodynamics</li>
              <li>The one challenge that came at the top was about sampling considerations. In particular,
              Frost et al. claimed that this issue was particularly accute in phylogeography
              studies whereby oversampling of specific areas may lead to biases in the inference of
              migration parameters</li>

              <li>Before we dig in the core of this talk I would like to start off with a quick thought experiment</li>
              <li>So, let's imagine that you became aware of the presence of organisms of a new
                type, typically a virus or a bacteria, in four different places</li>
              <li>Because you have a vested interest in  phylogeography, you collect and compare the
              four genomes and corresponding locations</li>
              <li> From this analysis, you get an estimate of the rate of dispersion
                <li> Now, it turns out that you were unaware of the actual spatial distribution of
                your organism, which is in fact broader than what you would have expected from your
                  sample.</li>
              <li>Now, the question is: would you get a different if the actual spatial distribution
              of your organism was this one or this one?</li>
              <li>The topic of this talk revolves around this sort of questions and, in particular,
              how statistical modelling can help asnwering it

              <li>Ok, so before I give an overview of the different approaches and models in
              statistical phylogeography, it is good to clarify what sort of data and broad
                assumptions we are dealing with in phylogeography</li>
              <li>First of all, the data consist in geo-referenced genetic sequences, that is to say
                sequences that are labelled with spatial coordinates</li>
              <li> The relationship between sequences and coordinates is not one-to-one, meaning
              that identical sequences can be found in different places and the same place can
                display different sequences</li>
              <li>Inference usually rely on a hierarchical approach whereby sequences convey
              information about the phylogeny, and the tree, combined with spatial coordinates at the
              tips of the tree, helps us infer the rate at which organisms disperse in space. Other
              useful information about the demography of the population of interest can also be
              estimated from the tree.

            <ul>
              <li>Now, in terms of the properties of the relevant statistical models, what are our
                options?</li>
              <li>Well, one often has to chose between a mechanistic model which is built on
              assumptions that directly derive from our understanding of the biological processes
                at hand.</li>
              <li>Unfortunately, mechanistic models are generally difficult to deal with from a
              computational standpoint. Compromises often need to be found, sometimes leading to
                models
              that only capture some of the main features of the biological processes at stake, with
                the benefit of an increased  computational, mathematical flexibility</li>
              <li>Also, biological processes unfold forward-in-time, making the inference an inverse
                problem since it aims at deciphering what the past was given data collected at
                present. So, one often needs to reverse the direction of time here. A good example
                is that of the Wright-Fisher model and the coalescent</li>
              <li>Finally, there are important
                considerations about the level at which modelling and inference takes place since
                one generally models the evolution of the whole population while the inference rest
                on the analysis of a sample taken from that population. Here again, the
                Wright-Fisher model and the coalescent approximation are a good illustration of
                that point</li>

                <li>Isolation-by-distance model sensu Wright-Malécot not consistent (Felsenstein's
                ''pain in torus'')</li>
                <li>Sometimes non-sensical, e.g., Brownian trajectories never intersect in two dimensions...
                <li>Sampling consistency: dispersal dynamics of a lineage depends on the size of the sample considered</li>

            <aside class="notes">
              <ul>
                <li>Experience shows that building models that combine genetic and spatial
                  information is a risky business</li>
                <li>In the 40s', Wright and Malécot proposed an extension of the Wright-Fisher
                model that incorporated a few extra, and apparently innocuous, assumptions about
                the way offspring disperse around their parents. Yet, Felsenstein showed that these
                  assumptions were contradictory and this contradiction led the model to make
                  unrealistic predictions about the spatial distribution of organisms in the long
                  term </li>
                <li>Another example, backward-in-time this time, is that of two Brownian
                  trajectories describing the movements of organisms towards the past. Although
                  using Brownian motion to model these movements seems like a good idea, we know
                  mathematically that two Brownian trajectories never intersect on a two-dimensional
                  space, making this model unsuitable</li>
                <li>Finally, some models lack sampling consistency, making the expected dispersal
                rate for instance depend on the number of individuals in the sample, which is, here
                again, problematic</li>

              extension of the Wright-Fisher model that regulates population density as opposed to
                the original version of the IBD model</li>
              <li>In particular, because it is a backward-in-time model, it does a good job at
              dealing with non-uniform sampling in different demes</li>
              <li>Also, the structured coalescent is considered as fairly slow but recent mathematical and computational advances, most notably
              implemented in the MASCOT plug-in for BEAST2, have substantially improved this aspect. 
              <li>In my opinion, the main limitation with this model has to do with the fact that

              <li>It is problematic indeed because this partitionning is not always driven by biology and demes
                sometimes reflect boundaries that have more to do with geography than the spatial
              dynamics of the organisms. Furthermore, the impact of the partition chosen on the
                parameter estimates is seldom assessed</li>
              <li>Finally, work by Greg Ewing and Allen Rodrigo has shown the occurence of ghost
                demes, that is to say, demes that were not sampled or hidden, can be
                problematic for estimating population sizes and migration rates.
              </li>
              <li>Back in 2016, together with colleagues from the university of Auckland, we
              implemented a Bayesian sampler that estimates the parameter of the spatial
              Lambda-Fleming-Viot model which is a structured coalescent where individuals are
              distributed along a continuum rather than partitionned across demes. Although this
              approach was succesfull in alleviating the limitations of the standard structured
              coalescent, it is quite involved computationally. Yet, we believe that there is room
              for improvement here and together with my postdoc, Johannes Wirtz, we are currently
              working on solutions to speed up the inference under this continuous structured coalescent</li>

              <li>In 2010 Lemey et al. proposed the relaxed random walk model which is very similar
              in spirit to the mugration model, the main difference being that individuals are
                distributed along a continuum instead of being partitionned into discrete demes</li>
              <li>So, we still have a non-mechanistic forward-in-time model, that models migrations
                using a Brownian diffusion process</li>
              <li>It is very efficient computationnaly since we can analytically integrate over the
                ancestral locations using a method that Felsenstein put forward in 1973.</li>
              <li>Yet, here again, we make the assumption that the tree-generating process is
              independent from the spatial dynamic, although because space is continuous, it could
              be the case that convergence to Kingman's coalescent applies under some circumstances</li>
              <li>But the most important pitfall of the relaxed random walk model in my opinion has
              to do with spatial sampling patterns. As we will see later, the model relies on very
                specific assumptions about the way individuals are sampled in space.  </li>
              <li>When these assumptions are violated, we showed in this study led by Nicola De Maio,
                that biases in the inference of parameters arise in a very similar fashion as with
                the mugration model.

              <li>Roughly speaking, this term corresponds to the probability that the evolutionary process generated
